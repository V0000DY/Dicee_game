# Dicee game

"Dicee game" is a simple way to resolve a dispute between two parties by rolling virtual six-sided dice. The page features two dice and a header declaring the winner based on the outcome of the roll. Whoever got the higher number on the die won the bet. The page contains a script written in Javascript, which uses the Math.random function to determine pseudo random numbers.
